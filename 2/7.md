7. Determination of density
==============================================

7.1 General
-----------------------

### 7.1.1 Terminology
In this standard, density is expressed in terms of mas density. The bulk density of a soil, p, is the mass per unit volume of the soil deposit including any water it contains. The dry density, pd??? is the mass of dry soil contained in a unit volume. Both are expressed in Mg/m3??? which is numerically the same as g/cm3???

Note. Weight density (unit weight)denoted by y??? is used when calculating the force exerted by a mass of soil, and is derived from the mass density by the equation.

y=pg???

where

g??? is the acceleration due to gravity (in m/s2???)

The value of y???(in kN/m3???) is numerically related to p???(in Mg/m3???) by the equation.

y=9.807p???
