5. Determination of the plastic limit and plastic index
============================================

5.1 General
-----------------------

The plastic limit is the empirically established moisture content at which a soil becomes too dry to be plastic. It is used together with the liquid limit to determine the plasticity index which when plotted against the liquid limit on the plasticity chart (see BS5930) provides a means of classifying cohesive soils. It is recognized that the results are subject to the judgement of the operator, and that some variability in results will occur.
