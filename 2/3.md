3. Determination of moisture content
========================================

3.1 General
----------------------
Water is present in most naturally occurring soils.The amount of water,expressed as a proportion by mass of the dry solid particles, known as the moisture content, has a profount effect on soil behaviour. In this context a soil is 'dry'when no further water can be removed at a temterature not exceeding 110 0C.
Moisture content is required as a guide to classification of natural soils and as a control criterion in recompacted soils and is measured on samples used for most field and laboratory tests. The oven drying method is the defonotive procedure used in standard laboratory practice.
