3. Determination of moisture content
========================================

3.1 General
----------------------
Water is present in most naturally occurring soils.The amount of water,expressed as a proportion by mass of the dry solid particles, known as the moisture content, has a profount effect on soil behaviour. In this context a soil is 'dry'when no further water can be removed at a temterature not exceeding 110 0C.???
Moisture content is required as a guide to classification of natural soils and as a control criterion in recompacted soils and is measured on samples used for most field and laboratory tests. The oven drying method is the defonotive procedure used in standard laboratory practice.
NOTE,In some situations, for example in the field control of earthworks, a rapid method of measurement of moisture content may be required and a number of rapid methods are available, e.g. the sand bath method, the microwave oven-drying method and the calcuim carbide method. It should not be assumed that these methods are appropriate for all soil types and when they are used on a particular soil some tests should also be carried out using the oven-drying method as a check.
A procedure for determining the mosture content at full saturation of chalk is described.

### 3.2 Oven-drying method

#### 3.2.1 General

This method covers the determination of the moisture content of a specimen of soil as a percentage of its dry mass.
The requirements of Part 1 of this standard where appropriate, shall apply to this test method.

### 3.3 Method for saturation mosture content of chalk

#### 3.3.1 General

The saturation moisture content of intact chalk lumps can be used, together with the chalk crushing value, to classify chalk in relation to its behaviour as a freshly placed fill material. This test is based on the determination of the dry density of the chalk lump, using the 'Immmersion in water method', and the calculation from it of the potential moisture content at saturation, assuming a value of 2.70 Mg/m3??? for the particle density of the chalk solids.
The requirement of Part 1 of this standard, where appropriate, shall apply to this test method.
