4. Determination of liquid limit
=======================================

4.1 General
----------------------------

The liquid limit is the empirically established moisture content at which a soil passes from the liquid state to the plastic state. It provides a means of classifying a soil, especially when the plastic limit (see [clause 5](/5/)) is also known.

Two main types of tests are specified. 

1. The first is the [cone penetrometer method], which is fundamentally more satisfactory than the alternative because it is essentially a static test depending on soil shear strengh. It is also easier to perform and gives more reproducible results. 
2. The second is the much earlier `Casagrande type` of test which has been used for many years as a basis for soil classification and correlation of engineering properties. The test introduces dynamic effects and is more susceptible to discrepancies between operators.

For both types of test an alternative rapid 'one-point' procedure is given, which may give less accurate results.

The method of sample preparation is the same for all of these tests.

TODO:
- Clause 5 link in para 1
- Needto add cone penetrometer method
- Need to add Casagrande type
