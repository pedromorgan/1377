9. Determination of particle size distribution
==============================================

9.1 General
------------------------

Two methods of sieving are specified.Wet sieving is the defintive method applicable to essentially cohesionless soil.Dry sieving is suitable only for soil containing insignificant quantities of silt and clay.

Two methods of determining the size distribution of fine particles down to the clay size by sedimentation are specified, namely the pipette method and the hydrometer method, in both of which the density of the soil suspension at various intervals is measured.

Combined sieving and sedimentation procedures enable a continuous partice size distribution curve of a soil to be plotted from the size of the coarsest partice down to the clay size.
 
 
9.2 Wet sleving method
--------------------

### 9.2.1 General
This method covers the quantitative determination of the particle size distribution in an essentially cohesionless soil, down to the fine sand size. The combined silt and clay fraction can be obtained by difference.

The procedure given involves preparation of the sample by wet sieving to remove silt and clay-sized particles, which are rejected, followed by dry sieving of the remaining coarser material.

If the soil does not contain particies retained on a 2mm test sieve in significant quantity, the method specified in 9.4 or 9.5 can be used.

The requirement of Part 1 of this standard, where appropriate, shall apply to the test method.
