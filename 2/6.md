6. Determination of shrinkage characteristics
=================================================

6.1 General
-----------------------

6.1.1 Objective
Shrinkage due to drying is significant in clays but less so in silts and sands, These tests enable the shrinkage limit, 
W ??? of clays to be determined, i.e.the moisture content below which the clay ceases to shrink. They also provide ways of quantifying the amount of shrinkage likely to be experianced by clays, in terms of the shrinkage ratio, volumetric shrinkage and linear shrinkage.

These factors are also relevant to the converse condition of expansion due to wetting.
